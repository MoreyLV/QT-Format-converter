# 🧩 FormatConverter

**FormatConverter** is a simple graphical application built with **Python (PyQt)** that allows users to convert image files between various data formats.  
It was designed to simplify format and resolution transformation without the need for external tools or command-line usage.
To be honest, I use it myself from time to time, and I think it’s a very good indicator.
